<p>Campus parking designations are determined by the type of permit you have. Student parking is in 'B' lots and Faculty/Staff parking is in 'A' lots. Non-permit holders and visitors must use NOVA hourly parking options.&nbsp; These include:&nbsp; <a href="https://ppprk.com/park/">Passport Mobile Pay</a>&nbsp;or payments via Pay Stations in hourly lots.&nbsp; Parking in 'B' lots and hourly lots/garages is free after 3:45 p.m. Monday through Friday and all day on the weekends.</p>
<p>Parking permits cost $80. Visitor parking is $2 an hour with a maximum of $10 per day.</p>
<p>Students may purchase their parking permits online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nvcc.edu/parking/index.html">www.nvcc.edu/parking</a>&nbsp;or at any campus Parking Services office.</p>
<p>Vehicles with valid DMV-issued plates or placards may park in any permit space located in an 'A', 'B', or hourly lot in addition to any designated handicap parking space on campus.</p>
